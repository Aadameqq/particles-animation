## 📰 About

This is <b>particles animation</b> made in <b><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a></b>. Each particle has a connection to another when they are close enough. The thickness of the line connecting the particles depends on their distance. 
<br> In this project, I tried to follow the principles of <b>clean code</b> and make most of the code <b>reusable</b>.
